Power Up and Connection: 
                  
                  When you turn on the car, the NodeMCU board uses WiFi to connect to the Blynk cloud.
                  
Blynk App Control:
                 
                  The Blynk app interface you created has buttons (Forward, Backward, Left, Right) and a slider.

Sending Commands:
                 
                  Pressing these buttons sends those commands (forward, backward, left, right) to the NodeMCU board via the Blynk cloud.

Motor Control: 
                 
                 The NodeMCU board interprets these commands and uses the L298N motor driver board to control the gear motors accordingly.

Speed Adjustment:
                 
                 The slider in the Blynk app allows you to control the speed of the motors.
                 

List of the components

NodeMCU ESP8266:
This is the brain of the car, a microcontroller board that connects to WiFi and runs the code to control the motors based on Blynk app commands.

L298N motor driver board:
This board acts as a bridge between the NodeMCU and the gear motors, allowing the NodeMCU to control the direction and speed of the motors.

Gear motors (4) and Robot wheels (4):
These are the driving force of the car, with the motors connected to the wheels for movement.

Battery holder and Li-ion batteries (2):
These provide power to the entire system.

Jumper wires:
These connect all the components together in the circuit.

Breadboard (mini): 
This is a helpful tool for prototyping circuits, allowing you to connect the components without soldering( mainly used to connect the 30 pin node mcu).
